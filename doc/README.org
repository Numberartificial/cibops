*** TODO finish complicate http request
i need to serialize some http requests.

**** TODO make the flat kind realization. 
SCHEDULED: <2017-03-28 Tue>
Yes, i am looking for a elegant way to chain a list off
requests; the examples listed in website are all single
http request.
Finally, i found this aritical, [[https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/10/11/elm-chain-http-requests/][elm-chain-http-requests]],
plenty of thanks.
  *NOTE*: i've found several place mismatch with nowadays
elm 0.18.0 version, and i make these overtime codes comment
in [[../src/Try/OrdinaryHttp.elm][OrdinaryHttp]].
Due to this situation, i think /remotedata/http/ is *over designed* 
to omit the elm task concept for asynchronous operations.

**** TODO chain requests demo 
   
***** TODO {while condition} pattern http requests chain
      i need to get a bunch of requests while response is legal.

      now i have:
      1. Task
      2. andThen
     
      taco is something bad for reuse function to
      express a UI component.

      taco maybe a misunderstanding of reusable and reliable function.
      i don't wanna use this taco pattern.

***** DONE there is a elm error                                         :bug:

     ``` elm-make src/Main.elm
-- SYNTAX PROBLEM ------------------------------------------ ./src/Pages/Ops.elm

I need whitespace, but got stuck on what looks like a new declaration. You are
either missing some stuff in the declaration above or just need to add some
spaces here:


I am looking for one of the following things:

i am looking for this weird problem.

i found this commit, thanks for git:
``` @@ -240,7 +241,7 @@ viewStargazers taco model =
  
  viewStargazer : Stargazer -> Html Msg
  viewStargazer stargazer =
 -    li [ styles (card ++ flexContainer) ]
 +    li [ styles (card ++ flexContainer) 
          [ img
              [ styles avatarPicture
              , src stargazer.avatarUrl
``` 
but, this compile warning is ambiguity.
**** TODO core concept in RemoteData
It's very clearly that RemoteData is a abstraction of
Model, not Cmd or Msg.
